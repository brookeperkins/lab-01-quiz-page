                Nomi is my first cat. When I lived in New York, his mother had her litter of kittens beneath my stoop,
                quickly abandoning them. I rescued the four kittens, and nursed them to health. My friends adopted the 
                other kittens when they were old enough, and I kept Nomi. He is now five years old. He is orange, with 
                white swirls along his belly and back. He loves to cuddle, and despite my best efforts, he remains a 
                pretty chunky guy.

            <h2>LEAF</h2>

            </div>
            <p>
                My partner adopted Leaf from the humane society a few months after we had moved to Portland. He is also 
                orange, but with darker orange swirls. He was just a kitten when we adopted him, and although he is now
                a year old, he remains relatively small. He is incredibly vocal about his struggles, his needs, and his 
                innermost desires, although it is hard to distinguish between the three.
